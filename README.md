## Ceramic Project

Ceramic is a decentralized data network, that allows for building composable Web3 applications. Since Ceramic decentralizes application databases, application developers can reuse data across applications and make them automatically interoperable.


This is a simple Next.js application, which uses Self.ID. It will allow users to login to the website using their wallet of choice, 
which will be linked to their 3ID. 

Then, allow the user to write some data to their decentralized profile, and be able to retrieve it from the Ceramic Network.
